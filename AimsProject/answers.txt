Question located: Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?

public void addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvds) {

        addDigitalVideoDisc(dvd);
    }
}
This is better, no array needed to be initialized, easy to use!
